## Indicator Description

The 'Market Structures MT5' indicator is designed to identify trend shifts in the market using peak and bottom analysis. It highlights the breaking of the last peak or bottom in order to capture potential trend reversals.

### Indicator Parameters

This indicator accepts a single parameter:

- Period (default: 14): The number of bars to consider for trend analysis. This parameter can be adjusted to fit different trading strategies.

### Indicator Calculation

The indicator iterates through the historical price data to identify trend structures. It checks for changes in trend based on the comparison of current and previous peaks and bottoms.

For an uptrend, it checks if the current peak is higher than the previous peak. Then, it checks if the current peak is not broken by any subsequent bars within the specified period. If the current peak is not broken, it highlights the breaking of the last peak.

For a downtrend, it checks if the current bottom is lower than the previous bottom. Then, it checks if the current bottom is not broken by any subsequent bars within the specified period. If the current bottom is not broken, it highlights the breaking of the last bottom.

The indicator uses an arrow symbol (code: 159) to indicate the breaking of the last peak or bottom.

## Usage

To use this indicator, follow these steps:

1. Install the 'Market Structures MT5' indicator on your MT5 platform.
2. Adjust the period parameter according to your trading strategy.
3. The indicator will plot arrows on the chart to highlight the breaking of the last peak or bottom, indicating potential trend reversals.
